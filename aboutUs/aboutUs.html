Learning to code with CFG has been great and I hope if can help me to better understand the more techy parts of my job! My favourite cuisines are Italian and Asian - pretty much anything with pasta or noodles!</p>

            <p class="imgInfo">I'm Laura and I've recently moved into an SDET role, the CFG course has been brilliant for me in understanding the structure of how websites are built as this will help massively when I'm automating tests for front end applications. I love eating Italian food & Thai - especially when it's super spicy!</p>

            <p class="imgInfo">I'm Sadie and I'm currently a Campaign Executive at E.ON and am looking to move into something more in the digital/ social media space. I wanted to learn coding so that I could understand the background behind the build of webpages. I'm also in the process of starting up my own fashion brand (finally making use of my Fashion Design degree) and really wanted to code my own website for this. I think it's a great skill to have, I've loved learning it all and I think Code First Girls is a wonderful concept - so thank you CFG!                                </p>
